# Learning Git and Github - How I Finally Learned
## by Timothy Hoang
### Pharmacist to Front End Developer

## Why I didn't learn this skill initially
I never placed much importance in learning Git and Github when I initially started learning web development. It was hammered that learning core programming with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is more important. You need to practice your chops, learn fundamentals concepts, and build projects. That last item was where I found that it became absolutely imperative to finally learn about this unforgiving black screen with a blinking cursor.

I was just like everyone else by starting out on Codecademy and fooling around with all the different tutorials. "Learn HTML & CSS", "Learn JavaScript", "Make A Website", "Learn Git", and the short courses go on. Then, I experienced it again when I was doing [The Web Developer Bootcamp]() with Colt Steele. Don't get me wrong by saying that this is a really great course to learn web development; but, it still didn't give me that kind of depth I needed. Most of these tutorials on these different courses/websites throws Git/Github into the mix but they never actually taught you actually how to use it in a real project. I understand it is necessary because they need to focus on their main course topic. Sporadically, I ran across Git and Github through my web development journey but never actually took a serious attitude with it.

All that changed when I started working with a remote team with [Chingu-Voyage]() Free Code Camp group. With my initial team, the intermediate-level project to clone the popular Chrome Extension "Momentum Dash" never actually took off due some family issues within the team and . I eventually found my way into another team called Turtles-Team-2. Don't mind the name as Turtles are basically all the intermediate level students. I was thrown into a project that was already about 80% completed. I didn't have a clue about how to contribute to the project besides adding, commiting, pushing. What I thought I knew didn't help with the introduction of different branches, merging the team's work into my own branch, with merge pull request among other things.

## Where I went to learn for free
Luckily at that time, I was currectly going through some Git/Github courses in preparation to work with my portfolio website. I thought about reviewing the previous courses on the topic but I figured that wouldn't help too much. Then, there's reading a book about git and github but this might not help with all the moving parts when working with a real project. They might teach the concepts really well but I think the best way to learn is to actually see pragmatic examples, working through the software, and having a good course. I started looking for in-depth courses online but some of them were paid. I'm a big believer in learning web development mostly for free/cheap since there are tons-o-resources online to learn anything. My search continued...until I came across Udacity. It turns out that they actually had 3 really great courses that were free!

I started with [How to Use Git and Github]() with Sarah and Caroline. It was a good started and I learned some useful commands, setting up my terminal, and deep theory. I thought this would be the course that finally did it but I was wrong. We all learn differently and this course just did not suit my learning style. Althought many parts of the course were useful, I did not particularly enjoy the concept maps, interview clips, and examples that gave me errors when I went through them. Most of all, I didn't feel like I picked up the chops I needed to work with Turtles-Team-2.

Then, I wanted to give Udacity another chance. A newer course with Richard Kalehoff entitled "[Version Control with Git]()" finally did it for me. The course was practical, examples flowed well, and there wasn't as much theory. The bulk of the course requires you to run through exercises and work through your own Github account. The course also works well for absolute beginners but takes a steady pace to build your understanding. The course most importantly showed me the kind of work flow that I would experience on the team. I learned all the basic commands I would need to know to navigate through most issues. The course explains creating a git repository, reviewing a git repository's history, adding commits, branching & mergin, and other topics.

The great thing was that the course didn't end there. Following the same teaching style, Richard Kalehoff did it again with the follow up to [Version Control with Git]() about how to collaborate on Github. Aptly named, "[Github and Collaboration]()" led me further down the river and gave me more necessary kayak tools and knowledge, proverbially speaking. The course helps explain the commands fetch versus pull, pushing to a repository, and contributing to open-source. 

With all this knowledge, my team's chrome extension clone gave me a real life working example to play around in. It was a bit daunting as I was afraid I would fudge something and destroy their project! However, I trusted in the knowledge I gained and reminded myself that there are multiple copies of the repository on my computer, my teammate's computers, and on Github. If I screw something up, there are multiple backup copies in a sense. Pretty soon I was making way into making commits, pushing my changes to the project, and feeling much more comfortable with this black screen of death. I was so comfortable that I eventually implemented the terminal into my code editor (VS Code) and using it every day now!

## Conclusion
[learn from udacity]
[customize your terminal]
[use it everyday]
[start using it on your own projects]
[did you know you can write markdown?]
