## Introduction
I'm sitting here at day 95 of my 100 days of code challenge. You might be wondering why I'm writing about 100 days of code and selling you short 5 days. Frankly, I've learned what I needed already to in order to write this article for you so don't worry! Haha. Besides, I'm pretty much coding everyday from this point onwards but let me know get ahead of myself. You can go ahead and take that message home from this article and just skipping reading all together. The important thing is I want you to code daily and if you get anything from my article, that's all I want. There, now do you still feel like you got short-changed? I just gave you the biggest nugget of them all. Let's continue...

Let me tell you why I coincided El Penol de Guatape with my coding journey. I had the grand opportunity of living in Colombia, South America for months during my work hiatus. Yes, I was a bum but I was a bum learning to code though! In Colombia, there are many beautiful, exotic places to visit like Parque Tayrona, Comuna Trece, Palomino, Cerro El Volador, Cerro Quitasol, Parapente Medellin, and much, much more. If you ever want to go to Colombia for it's evergreen spring weather, cheap cost of living, and beautiful places to see & do, just write me up. I've lived there for nearly half a year so I would know a thing or two.

Anyways, El Penol de Guatape was one of these wonderful places I visited during my stay and it is of monster-size rock to freaking climb. Count 740 steps to the uppermost summit of the rock and yellow painted numbers to remind of your grueling ascent along the way. I can attest that 100 days of code wasn't as physically challenging but it was almost as mentally challenge over a longer period of time. That's however you defined your challenges everyday though. Mines was to simply code as much as I can before life gets in my way daily. Trust me, those daily things tug and pull at you along the way. How did I keep myself in-gear and focused? Read onwards, my coding friend.

## Keeping a log is easy-peazy
One thing I did during my journey was to write 2 or 3 sentences daily about my coding progress. It started out on a slack channel when I was a part of a Chingu team. The fact was that I joined too late and didn't get assigned to a team but I accept full responsibility for that. It's rather hard to code when you're just returning Japan and you have been checking out all the cool attractions everyday. Got that? They had a daily-log section in the slack team and I steadily plugged away my daily progress even though I wasn't actually coding with anyone on there. I still stuck to my tutorials and projects everyday as much as I could.

I told myself if I could I can code for 15 minutes initially, I can surely write 2 or 3 sentences daily. That's what I did for the most part. A little every day goes a long way, bud so gambatte! Later I noticed I started getting reactions from members in the team and that motivated me even more to keep logging everyday and coding. Sometimes, people would interject to ask about my projects and the tools I used so that kept me at it too.

Keeping a log doesn't have to be difficult, I started out on a slack channel for crying out loud. Later, I migrated to Twitter as I noticed I got more support from strangers on the internet. Yes, not my first brush with random people liking your posts. Anyways, it felt good and I kept going. Pretty soon, I posted everyday even when I didn't have much to report. Sometimes, traveling with layovers and red-eye flights makes you tired, I get that. So I would just try my best to generate ideas for my projects and review what I learned. Don't let the situation define your learning. Except WiFi connection, that will break your learning and ruin your life. I'm kidding...carry a JavaScript book or code offline. How do you think developers work and travel so much? You best be starting this skill if you're becoming a travel developer. Wink Wink.

## Things I did during my 100 days
Let's get to the meat of the article, what did I actually do during my 100 days of code? I'm going to break it up here for notable moments of each 25-days. I even had to take a break from my vlogging at the time also to focus on coding, not that I miss it too much since I vlogged for 90 days straight. I know I'm a little bit of a focus nut but maybe that's why I'm good at 100 days of code, wouldn't you say? I just got back from Japan around this time and this was when I actually started logging about my 100 days. Yes, I was coding in Japan but didn't really start logging until I got back. I just noticed that as I am parsing through my twitter log here. Let's crack on.

For days 1 through 25, I was working on the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" and "JSON APIs and Ajax" section of the Free Code Camp curriculum. On about day 12, I started working on the "Intermediate Front End Development Projects". At about day 15, I managed to build a quote machine app with quotes I found and also an API version of the app. Then I started building the weather app API after that and finished around day 22. The weather app was pretty difficult since you have to adapt may APIs to codepen.io which gave me a lot of grief. Then on day 23, I signed up for "What the Flexbox" course with Wes Bos. 

For days 26 through 50, I continued with the Flexbox course and finished about day 27. During this time, I was also applying for Chingu-Voyage's Build-To-Learn cohort. I was excited since I would be able to collaborate with people now and not coding alone! Also on day 27, I decided to reinforce my Flexbox learning and signed up for "Flexbox Zombies" with David Geddes. I remembered I played that game for like 4 hours or more a day and finished "Flexbox Zombies" around day 30. Around day 31, I started to prepare for my Chingu-Voyage Team. Uneventually, there were some troubles with my team lead so the project never took off but I continued on with learning CSS grids through Rachel Andrew's website on day 33. I watched a lot of talks and played around with it. However, version control crept it's ugly head again so I decided to handle it and started Udacity's "Git and Github" on day 39 and finished on day 43. That's when I started a superior, modern Git course called "Version Control with Git" with Richard Kalehoff on day 45 and finished day 49. 

For days 51 through 75, My Chingu-Voyage project still didn't take off. Sad face. So on day 51, I started the continuation of the course with Richard with "Github and Collaboration" and finished on day 60. Now I felt like a Git/Github pro which will soon be put to the test when I joined another Chingu-Voyage team on day 57 to clone the popular Chrome Extension Momentum Dash. On day 60, I also decided to strip my portfolio site that I built in November 2016 to apply Flexbox, various tutorials, and version control knowledge. Through my time with the Chingu-Voyage team, I did some animations & transitions for picture credits, implementing a google search function in the app, and applied more transitions to the to-do list and settings options. On day 63, I started the "JavaScript: The Tricky Stuff" as part of the Colt Steele course on Udemy. During this time, I also fell in love with Visual Studio Code and cleaned up a significant part of my Github profile.

For days 76 to 95, I started "Practical JavaScript" with Gordon Zhu and continued on with my portfolio website. Day 78 was the day we finished our team app for Chingu-Voyage because that's when I wrote a Chrome Web Store description for my team. I finally finished Practical JavaScript on day 89. I also re-coded my quote machine app without codepen on day 79. I decided that codepen was too clunky and I wanted more practice with using Github to host my projects. Then, I went to a "Intro to React" workshop on day 87, which didn't turn out to be all that great but got me inspired to learn more. I also published my first blog article entitled "Learning Git and Github - Now Hating That I Love It" on day 89 which wasn't too difficult to write but I really got a kick of revisiting my writing skills. After I finished my quote machine app, I started re-coding my weather app without codepen on day 91 and still working on it today (day 95). I noticed that I was not back in the states so I wanted to collaborate with my developer friend to host events for our local Free Code Camp group on day 91. I went to a CSS grids layout with speaker Jesse Eldredge on day 93. That weekend, we had our first FCC meetup on day 94 which was really productive! That finally brings us to today, day 95. Phew!

## Why and how you should log daily
So am I saying you should code for 100 days and log it just so you can write an article like me? I certainly hope not. You should write an article if you want to. The reason you should log is because it is an amazing habit builder. When I was in pharmacy school and doing various self-improvement projects, I was taught that if you can do something for 30 days, or even better 90 days, you build a very strong habit. It makes you feel certainly guilty for skipping out on your task. For a strong organizational type like me, I rely on structure, predictability, and repeatability to learn. Yup, I'm just a big dumb ape on this rock that needs a couple hits to the head to get things through! Haha.

You also make good friends along the way as I have since they give you a like, comment, or help you with your journey if you share it publicly. Decide to start with a small notebook, twitter, facebook, or a slack channel like I did! When you finish you have something to look back on after the journey is finished which is kind of a nice "yearbook" effect for your journey. We humans are also a very forgetful creature so recounting the things we did yesterday will help us get us focused. Since you're human, let me remind you on how you get started.

Level one is to start logging your journey every day with 1 or 2 sentences about whatever you're doing whethere it's 100 days of code, 100 pounds to lose, or reading 100 books. This will reinforce that guilt factor into you so that you don't get off track. Even if you do only 5, 10, or 15 minutes worth of it, that's better than nothing at all. Also, through my years of learning, when you start something it is mighty difficult to get the ball rolling. However, once you got something started, it's really hard to want to stop. At least that's how it feels for me anyways. I hope it's the same for you.

Level two is to start logging your journey publicly for all the world and your mother to see. You wouldn't want your mother scolding you right? This adds another level of accountability beyond the guilt factor with pride. This cardinal sin of 7 will hopefully make you want to save face by not being humilated in front of others (althought it won't ever get that far). If you're more of the competitive type, you might want to bet ahead or beat your friends/opponents in the race. That's a good motivator too. There might be a million reasons to start sharing your public journey but have your pick and do it!

## Conclusion
I'm finally glad that 100 days of code are over but I'm going to continue with this momentum that I've built with it! My next plan? Hit 30 days of JavaScript with Wes Bos and doing Free Code Camp until I finish the front end certification. Although I won't tweet with #100daysofcode, you and I know that I will still be tweeting every day about my progress. I'm looking for another tag like that but only found #codedaily, #codeeveryday, or #code247. I'm sure I'll find some tag to add of course. The more important things will be the projects I'm working on of course. I'm hoping in the next 100 days, I will be applying to jobs and landing my first junior developer position also! I'm super excited about that!

As you can see, 100 days of code is a lot like El Penol de Guatape. There are many steps and days in your journey ahead but you must push onwards. As things get rough, remember that it makes you stronger and gets you one step closer to your goal. If you can walk with your friend and talk about the journey, it makes it go by even faster. Before you know it, you will have reached the top of the 740 steps and blessed with a breathtaking view of the landscape. I hope that you get to see Colombia in your lifetime as I did as there are much more beautiful things that a picture can't do proper justice. Let me know if you're going!

What's the takeaway from this article? Don't stop coding and log about your coding daily. It builds strong habits, helps you make friends, and helps develop your coding skills! Don't let something as silly as 100 days of code challenge make you stop there. Why shoot for the top of the ladder when you can shoot for the stars? I hope this article has motivated or inspired you to take action about logging your coding progress. If you feel something like that, I feel like I've done some good here today. This is travelDev signing off and wish you a great journey. Adios amigo!
